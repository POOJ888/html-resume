    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <P>
        I’m a curious mind who loves solving problems, creating things, and constantly learning. While I have a background in psychology, my passion led me to explore tech, design, and AI, where I now work on building intuitive apps, designing user-friendly experiences, and diving into data science.
        <br> <br>
        Beyond work, I’m into fitness, long conversations, and discovering creative ways to blend psychology with technology. I enjoy jogging, experimenting with design ideas, and binge-watching psychological thrillers. Life, for me, is all about growth, creativity, and making things that truly add value.
